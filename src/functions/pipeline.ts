Company Context:
${companyContext}

Guidelines:
- Do not use any specific lead data in the group descriptions. For example, none of the group descriptions should mention or be tailored to one specific lead or company. REMEMBER THIS.
- Group descriptions must be general enough to apply to any company in the group, not just one.
- BAD EXAMPLE (do NOT do this): "<Your company name> can offer specialized services to Company A, focusing on..."
- GOOD EXAMPLE (do this): "<Your company name> can offer specialized services for companies in the <group name> sector, focusing on..."
- The purpose of these groups is to help us craft tailored sales outreach messages to the leads.
- Each group should represent a distinct angle or approach our company can use to help or provide value to the leads in that group.
- Create groups that are relevant and meaningful within the context of our company and our offerings.
- Avoid making groups that are too specific or granular; each group should represent a significant, actionable category for sales outreach, not a trivial distinction.
- Make sure the group descriptions are general enough that they can be used for a wide range of leads.
- Prefer broader, business-relevant groupings that would help our company take action or make decisions.
- If unsure, err on the side of fewer, more general groups rather than many highly specific ones.

Existing Groups:
${
  groups.length === 0
    ? "No groups created yet"
    : groups.map((g) => `${g.name}: ${g.description}`).join("\n")

- Write a fully polished, highly personalized, and actionable sales pitch that is ready to use as-is.

- Do NOT reference the group, recipient, or their company anywhere in the pitch.
- The pitch should NOT be in the form of an email, letter, or messageâ€”just a paragraphed, engaging, and insightful description of the value and services offered.
- Only talk about our company and its offerings, tailored to the needs and context of the group.
- Make every part specific, relevant, and complete.
- End with a strong, relevant call to action that encourages immediate engagement.
